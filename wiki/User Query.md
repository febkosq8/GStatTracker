User can utilize [this](https://gstatviewer.pages.dev/user) page to get information about a particular GitHub user and their repositories. When logged in, our app will be able to access private data if available.

The UI includes an input bar where the _username_ of the author is given, a dropdown to select the amount of entries to be shown [per page](https://github.com/febkosq8/GStatTracker/wiki/Features#max-entries-per-page) along with the submit button.

On getting a successful response, the app provides a page selector along with :

- User Name
- Name
- GitHub ID
- Creation Timestamp
- Followers
- Following
- Total Count of Repositories
- List of Repositories
  - Repository Name
  - Visibility
  - Creation Timestamp
  - Description
  - URL
