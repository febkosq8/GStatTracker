User can utilize [this](https://gstatviewer.pages.dev/repocommit) page to get information about all commit's made to a GitHub Repository. When logged in, our app will be able to access private data if available.

The UI includes an input bar where the _repository directory (author/repository name)_ , a dropdown to select the amount of entries to be shown [per page](https://github.com/febkosq8/GStatTracker/wiki/Features#max-entries-per-page) is given along with the submit button.

On getting a successful response, the app provides a page selector, a filter by author along with:

- Number of Commits being shown
- Button that will Show / Hide a Line Graph depicting the Number of Commits per Author per Day
- List of Commits
  - Commit SHA
  - Date
  - Author
  - Message
