User can utilize [this](https://gstattracker.tk/commit) page to get information about a particular commit made to a GitHub Repository. When logged in, our app will be able to access private data if available.

On getting a successful response, the app provides us with :

- Commit SHA

- Message
- Number of Additions, Deletion and Total Changes
- Table for File Change History
  - File Name
  - Change Type
