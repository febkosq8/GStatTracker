## **For getting access to private user data our application requires that you install our [GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/gstat-tracker) into your account.** [Read More](https://github.com/febkosq8/GStatTracker/wiki/Features#authentication-system)

To do this follow the New User Login flow when trying to login through our Application. If users dont install the GitHub App, then no private user information cam be accessed by the application. The installation is valid until the user or the developer revokes it. So, if you have already at least once followed the New User Login flow or your GitHub App installation was revoked for some reason, then please use the Existing User Login Flow to gain full access to GStat Tracker.
